3. **Enhanced Job Results Display (v2.6.0)**
   - Shows actual results for completed jobs (last 15 lines)
   - Shows error details for failed jobs (last 10 lines)
   - Full log viewing available via menu
   - Proper result capture and display

4. **Dynamic UI Sizing (v2.7.0)**
   - Dialogs automatically size based on content
   - Terminal-aware sizing (fits within boundaries)
   - Scrollable view for very long content (>2000 chars)
   - Full visibility for job results and config names

5. **Persistent Log Viewer (v2.8.0)**

## Critical Code Sections

### Job Management (snowflake_etl.sh)
- Lines 532-592: `start_background_job()` - Core job execution
- Lines 593-594: `start_foreground_job()` - Real-time execution wrapper
- Lines 769-917: Job result display functions
- Lines 665-765: `show_all_jobs_summary()` - Enhanced with results
- Lines 894-929: `view_job_full_log()` - Persistent log viewer with 'less'

### Dynamic UI Sizing (snowflake_etl.sh)
- Lines 53-88: `calculate_dialog_dimensions()` - Content-based sizing
- Lines 91-101: `get_terminal_size()` - Terminal detection
- Lines 530-610: `show_message()` - Dynamic message display
- Lines 475-536: `show_menu()` - Dynamic menu sizing

### Smart Table Selection (snowflake_etl.sh)
- Lines 108-147: `get_tables_from_config()` - Extract tables from config
- Lines 150-244: `select_table()` - Intelligent table selection

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. Very long job names might need truncation in some views
2. Terminal size detection fallback to 24x80 if tput unavailable
3. Some legacy functions still use inline Python execution (being phased out)

### Areas for Improvement
1. Email notifications not yet implemented
2. Web dashboard interface planned but not started
3. Checkpoint/resume for interrupted batch runs pending
4. Memory optimization for 50GB+ files still needed

## Environment & Dependencies

### Required
```bash
# Python packages
pip install snowflake-connector-python pandas numpy tqdm

# System tools
python3, bash, grep, cut, wc, sed, awk, tput (optional)
```

### Optional but Recommended
```bash
# For better UI
apt-get install dialog  # or whiptail

# For performance monitoring
pip install psutil
```

## Testing Coverage

### Automated Tests Created
1. **test_job_management_v2.sh** - Comprehensive job system testing
   - Job creation and tracking
   - Progress display verification
   - Result capture testing
   - Error handling validation

### Manual Testing Performed
- Dynamic UI sizing with various content sizes
- Job result display for completed/failed/running jobs
- Table selection with single/multiple/no tables in config
- Black screen issue resolution verified

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Memory Optimization**
   - Implement streaming validation for file-based QC
   - Optimize for 50GB+ file processing
   - Profile memory usage patterns

2. **Error Recovery**
   - Add retry mechanism for failed operations
   - Implement checkpoint/resume for batch runs
   - Better error messages and recovery guidance

3. **Enhanced Reporting**
   - Export validation results to CSV/Excel
   - Email notifications for job completion
   - HTML reports with charts

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Web Dashboard**
   - Real-time job monitoring
   - Historical data visualization
   - Interactive controls

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Connection pooling for Snowflake
   - Parallel validation improvements
   - Streaming compression

## Configuration Examples

## Commands to Remember

```bash
# Run with real-time progress
./snowflake_etl.sh  # Choose 'Y' for foreground

# Check job status
./snowflake_etl.sh status

# View full job results
# Navigate to Job Status > View Log: [job_name]

# Test job management
./test_job_management_v2.sh

# Quick duplicate check
./snowflake_etl.sh
# Data Operations > Check Duplicates
```

## Final Notes

The system is now production-ready with comprehensive job management, dynamic UI, and full result visibility. All major user experience issues have been addressed. The next session should focus on performance optimization and advanced features like web dashboard and email notifications.

Key achievement: Users can now see everything - no truncated results, no black screens, no hidden information. The UI adapts to content automatically.
