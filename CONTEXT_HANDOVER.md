# Context Handover Document

*Purpose: Transfer critical context to next session*

## Session Summary

We made significant progress on the **Major Refactoring Initiative** to transform the codebase from singleton-based architecture to dependency injection. This was triggered by realizing that our end goal is to have everything run through the unified wrapper (`snowflake_etl.sh`) rather than calling individual Python scripts.

## Critical Architectural Decision

**Question Asked**: "We want to eventually remove the underlying batch scripts and integrate with our wrapper script - does your decision on singletons still hold?"

**Answer**: NO! This completely changed our approach. Instead of singletons (which made sense for independent script execution), we pivoted to dependency injection since we'll have:
- Single Python process handling all operations
- Connection pool persisting across operations
- Shared resources managed by ApplicationContext

## What We Built

### 1. ApplicationContext (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
**Location**: `snowflake_etl/core/application_context.py`
- Central dependency injection container
- Manages: connection pool, config manager, logging, progress tracker
- Resources created once, injected into all operations
- Includes BaseOperation class that all operations inherit from

### 2. Refactored Connection Manager (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
**Location**: `snowflake_etl/utils/snowflake_connection_v3.py`
- Removed singleton pattern completely
- Standard class instantiated by ApplicationContext
- Uses native Snowflake connection pooling
- Includes retry logic and health checks

### 3. ConfigManager V2 (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
**Location**: `snowflake_etl/utils/config_manager_v2.py`
- Uses `functools.lru_cache` for efficient caching
- Environment variable overrides (SNOWFLAKE_ETL_* prefix)
- Multi-config file support with merging

### 4. Logging Configuration (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
**Location**: `snowflake_etl/utils/logging_config.py`
- Declarative configuration using `dictConfig`
- Operation-specific log files
- No more singleton LogManager

### 5. Progress Tracking Abstraction (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
**IMPORTANT**: We completely redesigned progress tracking!
- **Old**: Complex 291-line ProgressTracker with bash parallelism support (TSV_JOB_POSITION env var)
- **New**: Clean abstraction with multiple implementations

**Files**:
- `snowflake_etl/core/progress.py` - Abstract interface and basic implementations
- `snowflake_etl/ui/progress_bars.py` - Tqdm implementation (simplified)

**Key Insight**: The old ProgressTracker was built for bash-level parallelism that's no longer needed in the unified architecture.

### 6. Unified CLI Entry Point (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
**Location**: `snowflake_etl/cli/main.py`
- Single entry point for all operations
- Subcommands: load, delete, validate, report, check-duplicates, compare
- Creates ApplicationContext once, passes to operations

### 7. Extracted Components (PARTIAL)
We started extracting classes from `tsv_loader.py`:
- ‚úÖ `FileConfig` ‚Üí `snowflake_etl/models/file_config.py`
- ‚úÖ `FileAnalyzer` ‚Üí `snowflake_etl/core/file_analyzer.py`
- ‚úÖ `DataQualityChecker` ‚Üí `snowflake_etl/validators/data_quality.py`
- üöß `SnowflakeLoader` - Started but not complete (complex, needs refactoring)
- ‚è≥ `SnowflakeDataValidator` - Not started

## Key Design Patterns

### Dependency Injection Pattern
```python
# Old way (singleton)
class SnowflakeConnectionManager:
    _instance = None
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# New way (dependency injection)
class ApplicationContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_manager = SnowflakeConnectionManager()
        
class SomeOperation(BaseOperation):
    def __init__(self, context: ApplicationContext):
        self.context = context
        # Access shared resources via context
```

### Progress Tracking Pattern
```python
# Operations report progress through abstract interface
self.progress_tracker.update_phase(ProgressPhase.QUALITY_CHECK)
self.progress_tracker.update_progress(rows_processed=1000)

# ApplicationContext decides which implementation to inject
if quiet_mode:
    tracker = NoOpProgressTracker()  # No output
else:
    tracker = TqdmProgressTracker()  # Visual bars
```

## What's Next (Phase 2 Continuation)

### Immediate Priority
1. **Complete SnowflakeLoader extraction**
   - Current blocker: It's 400+ lines with complex async COPY logic
   - Needs refactoring to use injected connection manager
   - Should be split into smaller, focused classes

2. **Extract SnowflakeDataValidator**
   - Located around line 651 in tsv_loader.py
   - Performs validation directly in Snowflake tables
   - Includes duplicate detection logic

3. **Create LoadOperation wrapper**
   - Orchestrates the loading process
   - Uses all extracted components
   - Inherits from BaseOperation

4. **Update snowflake_etl.sh**
   - Change from calling individual Python scripts
   - Call unified CLI: `python3 -m snowflake_etl.cli.main`

## Collaboration with Gemini

We had excellent discussions with Gemini about:
1. **Singleton vs DI**: Initially defended singletons for batch scripts, then agreed DI is better for unified architecture
2. **Snowflake Native Pooling**: Gemini suggested using built-in pooling instead of manual management
3. **Config Caching**: Suggested `functools.lru_cache` instead of manual caching
4. **Logging**: Recommended `dictConfig` for declarative configuration
5. **Progress Tracking**: Strongly recommended abstract interface pattern

## Critical Insights

1. **Architecture Evolution**: Started with individual scripts ‚Üí Added wrapper ‚Üí Now unifying backend to match
2. **No More Bash Parallelism**: The complex position calculations for progress bars are obsolete
3. **Shared Resources**: Connection pool persists across operations in same process
4. **Testing Benefits**: Can inject NoOpProgressTracker and mock connections for testing
5. **Performance**: Significant improvement from not recreating connection pools

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Test the refactored modules
python3 test_dependency_injection.py
python3 test_progress_tracking.py

# See the new CLI in action (once operations are complete)
python3 -m snowflake_etl.cli.main --help

# Continue extracting from tsv_loader.py
# Focus on lines 651-1288 (SnowflakeDataValidator)
# and lines 1289-1673 (SnowflakeLoader)
```

## Notes for Next Session

1. **Don't revert to singletons** - We specifically moved away from them
2. **SnowflakeLoader is complex** - Consider breaking into smaller classes
3. **Keep progress tracking abstract** - Don't couple to tqdm
4. **Test with actual Snowflake** - We used mocks due to missing connector
5. **Update wrapper script** - snowflake_etl.sh needs to call new CLI

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) - COMPLETE
- üöß Phase 2 (Module Migration) - 40% complete
- ‚è≥ Phase 3 (Tool Migration) - Not started
- ‚è≥ Phase 4 (Shell Consolidation) - Not started

The refactoring is progressing well. The hardest part (architectural decision and core infrastructure) is done. Now it's mostly mechanical work of extracting and adapting existing code to the new patterns.
