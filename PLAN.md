# PLAN.md - Project Development Plan
*Last Updated: 2025-09-03*
*Current Version: 3.4.13*

## Project Overview

Snowflake ETL Pipeline Manager - A robust, enterprise-grade solution for loading large TSV files into Snowflake with comprehensive proxy support for restricted corporate environments.

## Current Status: Production Ready with Proxy Support

The system has evolved from v3.0.0 to v3.4.13 with major improvements in:
- Proxy handling for all network operations
- SSL/TLS support for corporate environments
- Script stability and error handling
- Compatibility with older package versions

## Completed Phases (as of 2025-09-03)

### Phase 1: Core Functionality ✅
- Unified menu system (snowflake_etl.sh)
- TSV loading with progress tracking
- Data validation and quality checks
- Parallel processing support

### Phase 2: Enterprise Features ✅
- Proxy support for PyPI packages
- Proxy support for Python downloads
- Proxy support for Snowflake connections
- SSL/TLS handling for corporate proxies
- Support for pre-downloaded packages

### Phase 3: Stability & Compatibility ✅
- Fixed silent script failures
- Fixed unbound variable errors
- Relaxed version requirements
- Added fallback mechanisms

## Active Development Areas

### Proxy & Network Optimization (In Progress)
**Goal**: Ensure reliable operation in restricted corporate environments

**Completed**:
- Unified proxy configuration across all components
- SSL/TLS workarounds for intercepting proxies
- HTTP/HTTPS protocol flexibility
- Connection pooling optimizations

**Next Steps**:
- Test with various corporate proxy types
- Add NTLM authentication support
- Implement automatic proxy detection
- Add proxy performance metrics

### Error Handling & Recovery
**Goal**: Graceful handling of all failure scenarios

**Planned**:
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Automatic fallback strategies
- Better error messages
- Connection diagnostic tools

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **snowflake_etl.sh** - Main entry point and menu system
2. **snowflake_etl/** - Python package with core logic
3. **Proxy Layer** - Unified proxy handling for all network operations
4. **SSL/TLS Layer** - Flexible SSL verification for corporate environments

## Version History Highlights

- **v3.0.0-3.0.3**: Initial production release with bug fixes
- **v3.4.0-3.4.3**: Proxy support for PyPI and Python
- **v3.4.4-3.4.9**: Script stability fixes and pre-download support
- **v3.4.10**: Relaxed Snowflake connector requirements
- **v3.4.11-3.4.13**: Comprehensive Snowflake proxy support

## Next Milestone: v3.5.0

### Goals
1. Full production deployment in corporate environment
2. NTLM authentication support
3. Automatic proxy detection
4. Performance monitoring dashboard

### Success Metrics
- Zero proxy-related failures
- <5 second connection establishment
- 100% compatibility with corporate security policies
- Successful loading of 50GB+ files

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Proxy Compatibility**: Different proxy types may behave differently
   - Mitigation: Multiple fallback strategies
   
2. **SSL Interception**: Corporate proxies may break SSL
   - Mitigation: Insecure mode option with warnings
   
3. **Package Availability**: Restricted repos may lack packages
   - Mitigation: Support for pre-downloaded packages

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Tests Needed
1. Test with Squid proxy
2. Test with corporate MITM proxy
3. Test with NTLM authentication
4. Test with restricted package repository
5. Test with 50GB+ TSV files

### Performance Benchmarks
- Connection establishment: <5 seconds
- Proxy negotiation: <2 seconds
- Package download: Within 20% of direct speed
- Snowflake COPY: 100K rows/second minimum

## Documentation Requirements

### To Be Created
1. Comprehensive Proxy Setup Guide
2. SSL/TLS Troubleshooting Guide
3. Performance Tuning Guide
4. Security Best Practices

### To Be Updated
1. README with proxy instructions
2. CLAUDE.md with new features
3. API documentation

## Support & Maintenance

### Known Issues to Monitor
- Corporate proxies with non-standard authentication
- SSL certificate pinning conflicts
- Package version availability in restricted repos

### Future Enhancements
1. Web UI for configuration
2. Automated proxy detection
3. Connection pool monitoring
4. Real-time performance metrics

## Conclusion

The project has successfully evolved to handle corporate proxy environments. The next phase focuses on production deployment, performance optimization, and comprehensive documentation. Version 3.4.13 represents a stable, proxy-aware system ready for enterprise deployment.
