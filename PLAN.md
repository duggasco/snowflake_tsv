# PLAN.md - Snowflake ETL Pipeline Development Plan
*Last Updated: 2025-08-26 Session 3*
*Version: 3.0.5*

## Project Status: PRODUCTION READY - Active Development

### Current State Summary
The Snowflake ETL Pipeline Manager is in production use with comprehensive features:
- **Architecture**: Fully refactored to dependency injection pattern
- **Test Coverage**: Complete test suite covering all CLI operations
- **User Interface**: Interactive menu system with quality check selection
- **Performance**: Optimized for 50GB+ files with async operations
- **Reliability**: All critical bugs fixed, robust error handling

## Recent Accomplishments (Session 3 - 2025-08-26)

### Critical Bug Fixes
1. ✅ **Fixed LoadOperation method error**
   - Corrected non-existent `check_data_quality()` call to `validate_file()`
   - Added proper error extraction from nested validation results
   - Tested with various validation scenarios

2. ✅ **Fixed test suite hanging**
   - Removed problematic timeout command causing hangs
   - Fixed arithmetic operations and string comparisons
   - Test suite now completes successfully

3. ✅ **Enhanced menu system**
   - Added QC selection prompts to all load operations
   - Users can choose: File-based, Snowflake-based, or Skip validation
   - Simplified menu by removing redundant options

## Active Development Areas

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Remote System Updates**
   - Remote systems need to pull latest changes for bug fixes
   - Monitor test results from production environments
   - Address any remaining tuple formatting issues

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Continue monitoring async COPY performance
   - Optimize memory usage for very large files
   - Consider distributed processing for parallel loads

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Run full regression tests on production data
   - Validate QC selection in all menu paths
   - Test with various file sizes and formats

```

### Key Design Principles
- **Dependency Injection**: All components use ApplicationContext
- **No Singletons**: Connection pooling without global state
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features degrade gracefully
- **Stream Processing**: Never load full files into memory

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Benchmarks (50GB file)
- Row counting: ~16 seconds
- File-based QC: ~2.5 hours (can be skipped)
- Compression: ~35 minutes
- Upload: ~3 hours
- Snowflake COPY: ~15-30 minutes (with async)
- Total: ~4 hours optimized (was 7-8 hours)

### Optimization Strategies
- Async execution for files >100MB
- ABORT_STATEMENT for fast failure
- Connection keepalive mechanism
- Stage cleanup before upload
- Auto-purge after successful load

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Core components, validators, operations
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows, error scenarios
- **CLI Tests**: All 20+ subcommands and options
- **Menu Tests**: Interactive navigation paths
- **Performance Tests**: Large file handling

### Test Infrastructure
- `run_all_tests.sh`: Master test orchestrator
- Virtual environment detection
- Offline/online mode switching
- Comprehensive reporting (HTML, text, archive)

## Deployment Guidelines

### For Production Updates
1. Pull latest changes from git
2. Run test suite (`./run_all_tests.sh`)
3. Verify configuration compatibility
4. Test with sample data
5. Deploy to production

### For New Installations
1. Clone repository
2. Create virtual environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Configure Snowflake credentials
5. Run system check
6. Execute test suite

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Monitor Production Usage**
   - Track performance metrics
   - Collect user feedback
   - Address any new issues

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README with QC selection
   - Document troubleshooting steps
   - Create migration guides

3. **Performance Profiling**
   - Profile memory usage patterns
   - Optimize hot paths
   - Consider caching strategies

### Medium Priority
1. **Enhanced Error Recovery**
   - Checkpoint/resume for batch operations
   - Better retry mechanisms
   - Improved error messages

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Email notifications
   - CSV/Excel export
   - Historical tracking

## Risk Management

### Known Risks
- Memory usage for 50GB+ files during file-based QC
- Network interruptions during long uploads
- Snowflake warehouse auto-suspend during operations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Offer Snowflake-based validation as alternative
- Implement checkpoint/resume functionality
- Add keepalive mechanisms (already done)
- Monitor and alert on long-running operations

## Success Metrics

### Current Performance
- ✅ 50GB files process in ~4 hours
- ✅ Test suite covers all functionality
- ✅ Zero critical bugs in production
- ✅ User-friendly menu system

### Target Goals
- Process 50GB files in <3 hours
- 100% test coverage with mocking
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Web dashboard for monitoring

## Communication Plan

### For Users
- Clear error messages with solutions
- Progress indicators for all operations
- Confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Comprehensive help documentation

### For Developers
- Well-documented code with docstrings
- Architecture diagrams
- Contributing guidelines
- Code review process
