# PLAN.md - Implementation Roadmap
*Last Updated: 2025-08-21*

## Project Vision
Create a production-ready, enterprise-grade ETL pipeline for Snowflake that handles massive TSV files with comprehensive data quality validation and monitoring.

## Current State (v3.1.0 - Performance Optimized)
✅ **Core Functionality**: Loading, validation, progress tracking, data deletion
✅ **Data Quality**: Anomaly detection, clear failure reasons, comprehensive validation
✅ **Performance**: Async COPY, optimized error handling, stage management
✅ **Batch Processing**: Parallel execution with comprehensive summary
✅ **User Experience**: Progress bars, diagnostic tools, always-visible critical data
✅ **Production Ready**: Security hardened, audit logging, recovery procedures

## Phase 1: Performance & Reliability (Next Sprint)
**Goal**: Handle 100GB+ files efficiently with <8GB memory usage

### Week 1: Memory Optimization
```python
# Current Issue: Loading entire chunks in memory
# Solution: Implement true streaming with generators

class StreamingValidator:
    def validate_dates_streaming(self, file_path, chunk_size=10000):
        """Generator-based validation to minimize memory"""
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            reader = csv.DictReader(f, delimiter='\t')
            chunk = []
            for row in reader:
                chunk.append(row)
                if len(chunk) >= chunk_size:
                    yield self.process_chunk(chunk)
                    chunk = []
```

### Week 2: Error Recovery
```python
# Implement retry decorator with exponential backoff
@retry(max_attempts=3, backoff_factor=2)
def snowflake_operation(self, query):
    try:
        return self.cursor.execute(query)
    except OperationalError as e:
        if "timeout" in str(e):
            self.reconnect()
        raise
```

### Week 3: Checkpoint System
```yaml
# Checkpoint file structure
checkpoint:
  batch_id: "2024-01-batch-001"
  status: "in_progress"
  completed_months: ["2024-01", "2024-02"]
  failed_months: ["2024-03"]
  current_month: "2024-04"
  current_file: 3
  total_files: 10
  last_update: "2025-08-21T10:30:00"
```

## Phase 2: Enhanced Reporting (Sprint 2)
**Goal**: Comprehensive reporting with multiple output formats

### Validation Report Generator
```python
class ValidationReporter:
    def generate_html_report(self, results):
        """Create interactive HTML report with charts"""
        # Use Plotly for interactive charts
        # Include drill-down capability
        # Export to PDF option
    
    def send_email_alert(self, results, recipients):
        """Send formatted email with validation summary"""
        # HTML email with inline charts
        # Attach CSV for detailed analysis
        # Include actionable recommendations
```

### Report Templates
1. **Executive Summary**: High-level metrics, trends
2. **Technical Report**: Detailed anomalies, SQL queries
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete processing history

## Phase 3: Advanced Validation (Sprint 3)
**Goal**: Flexible, business-specific validation rules

### Custom Validation Framework
```python
class ValidationRule:
    def __init__(self, name, condition, severity):
        self.name = name
        self.condition = condition  # Lambda or SQL
        self.severity = severity    # CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO

# Example custom rules
rules = [
    ValidationRule(
        name="Weekend Data Check",
        condition="COUNT(*) WHERE DAYOFWEEK(date) IN (1,7)",
        severity="WARNING"
    ),
    ValidationRule(
        name="Month-End Spike",
        condition="COUNT(*) WHERE DAY(date) = LAST_DAY(date)",
        severity="INFO"
    )
]
```

### Business Day Validation
- Skip weekends/holidays in completeness checks
- Configure holiday calendars by region
- Support for fiscal calendars

## Phase 4: Distributed Processing (Sprint 4)
**Goal**: Scale to multiple TB with distributed computing

### Architecture Options
1. **Dask Integration**
   ```python
   import dask.dataframe as dd
   
   def process_with_dask(file_path):
       df = dd.read_csv(file_path, sep='\t', blocksize="256MB")
       # Distributed processing across cores/nodes
       result = df.groupby('date').count().compute()
   ```

2. **Ray Implementation**
   ```python
   import ray
   
   @ray.remote
   def process_file_chunk(chunk_path):
       # Process chunk in parallel
       return validate_chunk(chunk_path)
   ```

3. **Snowflake Native**
   - Use Snowpark for server-side processing
   - Leverage Snowflake's compute clusters
   - Implement UDFs for custom validation

## Phase 5: Enterprise Features (Sprint 5)
**Goal**: Production-ready enterprise capabilities

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Encrypted credential storage (HashiCorp Vault)
- [ ] SSO integration
- [ ] Audit logging with tamper protection
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Data masking for sensitive columns

### Monitoring & Observability

name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          python -m pytest tests/
          python -m pytest integration/
      - name: Deploy
        if: success()
        run: |
          ./deploy.sh production
```

## Phase 6: UI/Dashboard (Future)
**Goal**: Web-based monitoring and management

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: React + Material-UI
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for live updates
- **Charts**: D3.js for custom visualizations

### Features
1. Real-time progress monitoring
2. Historical trend analysis
3. Drag-and-drop file upload
4. Visual validation rule builder
5. Automated report scheduling

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Process 100GB file in <2 hours
- [ ] Memory usage <8GB for any file size
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for batch processing
- [ ] <5 minute MTTR for common errors
- [ ] 100% validation coverage

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Performance Degradation**
   - Implement performance benchmarks
   - Set up automated alerts for slowdowns
   - Regular performance tuning sessions

2. **Data Quality Issues**
   - Comprehensive validation before production
   - Rollback mechanisms for bad data
   - Data quality SLAs with upstream systems

3. **Scalability Bottlenecks**
   - Load testing with synthetic data
   - Capacity planning models
   - Auto-scaling configurations

## Technical Decisions
1. **Why Python?** - Snowflake SDK support, data science ecosystem
2. **Why tqdm?** - Best-in-class progress bars, minimal overhead
3. **Why multiprocessing?** - True parallelism for CPU-bound operations
4. **Why JSON configs?** - Human-readable, version-controllable
5. **Why bash wrapper?** - Easy integration with schedulers, colored output

## Next Actions (Immediate)
1. Create feature branch for memory optimization
2. Set up performance benchmarking suite
3. Document current memory bottlenecks
4. Research streaming libraries (ijson, pandas chunks)
5. Create test dataset for 100GB file
