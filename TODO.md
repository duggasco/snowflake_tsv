## Next Session Priority ðŸŽ¯ - Fix Static Progress Bars Issue

### Critical Bug Fix
- [ ] Fix multiple static progress bars in parallel mode
  - [ ] Implement progress bar reuse in ProgressTracker
  - [ ] Update start_file_compression() to reset instead of recreate
  - [ ] Update start_file_upload() to reset instead of recreate  
  - [ ] Update start_copy_operation() to reset instead of recreate
  - [ ] Test with --parallel 3 --quiet to verify fix

### Implementation Tasks

  - [ ] Verify no static bars remain
- [ ] Test edge cases
  - [ ] Process interruption (Ctrl+C)
  - [ ] Mixed file sizes
  - [ ] Failed file processing
  - [ ] Sequential vs parallel mode switching

### Documentation Updates
