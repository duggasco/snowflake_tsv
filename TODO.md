## 🔍 Known Issues

### Proxy-Related
- Some corporate proxies may require additional authentication methods
- NTLM authentication not yet supported
- Certificate pinning may cause issues with SSL interception

### Compatibility
- Snowflake connector 2.7.5 works but newer versions preferred
- Python 3.11 recommended but 3.7+ should work
- Some package versions may be unavailable in restricted repos

## 📝 Notes

- All proxy settings are now unified across PyPI, Python downloads, and Snowflake
- Insecure mode should only be used in trusted environments
- The test_snowflake_proxy.py script helps diagnose connection issues
- Version 3.4.13 represents significant improvements in proxy handling
