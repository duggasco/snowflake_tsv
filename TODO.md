## üöÄ High Priority - Next Session

### Snowflake Connection Issues
- [ ] Test proxy configuration with actual corporate Snowflake instance
- [ ] Verify SSL/TLS settings work in production
- [ ] Document proxy troubleshooting steps
- [ ] Add retry logic for connection failures

### Testing & Validation  
- [ ] Full integration test with proxy environment
- [ ] Test with restricted package repositories
- [ ] Verify Python 3.11 installation process
- [ ] Test all fallback mechanisms

### Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive proxy setup guide
- [ ] Document SSL/TLS configuration options
- [ ] Add troubleshooting flowchart
- [ ] Update README with proxy instructions

## üìã Pending Features

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement connection retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add connection pool monitoring
- [ ] Optimize proxy connection reuse
- [ ] Add metrics for proxy performance

### Error Handling
- [ ] Better error messages for proxy failures
- [ ] Automatic fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Connection diagnostic tools
- [ ] Proxy validation before operations

## üîç Known Issues

### Proxy-Related
- Some corporate proxies may require additional authentication methods
- NTLM authentication not yet supported
- Certificate pinning may cause issues with SSL interception

### Compatibility
- Snowflake connector 2.7.5 works but newer versions preferred
- Python 3.11 recommended but 3.7+ should work
- Some package versions may be unavailable in restricted repos

## üìù Notes

- All proxy settings are now unified across PyPI, Python downloads, and Snowflake
- Insecure mode should only be used in trusted environments
- The test_snowflake_proxy.py script helps diagnose connection issues
- Version 3.4.13 represents significant improvements in proxy handling
